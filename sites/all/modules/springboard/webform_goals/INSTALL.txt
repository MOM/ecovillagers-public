In addition to enabling the Webform Goals module you need to do
a few more things to get the module working locally and
on remote sites.

--- Serving goal data ---
To minimize load on your server, webform_goals.jsonp.php parses goal widget files
and serves the contents via jsonp without bootstrapping Drupal.

To do this it needs to know how to find the webform_goals subdirectory in your files folder.

You will need to edit this file and change the following line:

// chdir('ABSOLUTE/PATH/TO/files/webform_goals');

Uncomment this line and change the file path to the absolute path to the webform_goals
subfolder.

Example:
  chdir('/var/www/sites/default/files/webform_goals');

--- Loading goal data locally ---
To display locally you will need to edit the following file:

scripts/webform_goals.drupal_loader.js

Modify the following line:

url = 'http://DOMAIN/PATH/TO/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php'

Replace DOMAIN with your site domain and PATH/TO with the path to the webform_goals module folder.

Example:
  url = 'http://example.com/sites/all/modules/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php'

--- Loading goal data on an external website ---
To display goal data from your site on other websites you will need to first edit
scripts/webform_goals.loader.js

Modify the following line:

url = 'http://DOMAIN/PATH/TO/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php'

Replace DOMAIN with your site domain and PATH/TO with the path to the webform_goals module folder.
Example: http://example.com/sites/all/modules/webform_goals/webform_goals.jsonp.php
