# Expand modules

To expand a module, add an include file to this directory that has the filename
structure of `my_module.inc`.  For example, if the module you wished to expand
was `views_bulk_operation` you would name the file `views_bulk_operation.inc`.
The include file will only be loaded if the original module is enabled.  The
list of expanded modules is cached, so clear the cache if the include file is
not loading properly.
