# About

[![Build Status](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/JacksonRiver/springboard_modules/badges/build.png?b=7.x-4.x)](https://scrutinizer-ci.com/g/JacksonRiver/springboard_modules/build-status/7.x-4.x)

This project contains only the Springboard-specific modules. It is not a
ready-to-use Springboard package. We provide packages [on this project's releases page](https://github.com/JacksonRiver/springboard_modules/releases).

If you'd like to build Springboard manually, you should checkout the [Springboard-Build](https://github.com/JacksonRiver/Springboard-Build) project, and use [drush make](http://drupal.org/project/drush_make) to create the package.

You should only need to checkout this repo directly if you want to contribute to the code. If you would like to regularly contribute to Springboard, consider [working for us](http://www.jacksonriver.com/about/jobs).
